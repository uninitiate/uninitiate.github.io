### Step 1
Try and Try and keep trying no matter how dumb you are and have no idea what you are doing/trying, as I've come this far and I've no idea what I'm doing/trying :-)

## My DevOps Journey Do far
Long Story... but in a short version.  After attending Code Vipassana for three seasons I decided to join their Discord server in late summer 2024.  Few weeks passed.  I then found out I can join other discord servers and joined the Google Developer Community, most likely after seeing a post in one of Code Vipassana's channel.  It was really interesting as there were so many channels and bumped into a post about a free Postman API course on LetsUpgrade.in in #India channel.  Enlisted on that course which needed a mobile number.  I then discovered LetsUpgrade's Discord server and joined it.  There I saw more links to YouTube videos and got interested in the Git course and eventually settled to watch their Git & GitHub Essential Bootcamp | 4th May https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2U8BLk0YRjAMseKd3w2UuJzL57TQ1J-c ; I did watch their newer version by another member but went through their youtube and picked the earliest one from their YouTude channel.  I learnt and practised the below after revisiting my Github repo I created when I tried the GitHub Skills training guide back in May 2024.  In the GCP Cloud Shell Editor I copied the contents of my repo from the Skills repo "skills-github-pages" into my main GitHup repo page "uninitiate.github.io."In the mean time I trinkered with few IDE's including Google's IDX project but settled on GCP Cloud Shell Editor (Mani Start-up School Oct-Nov2024):

1. git config global
2. git add .
3. git commit -m
4. Git Pages via the GitHub GUI
5. git auth login
6. create personal token in Github GUI and added to the GCP Cloud Shell Editor
7. git clone
8. git push
