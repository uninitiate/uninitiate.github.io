## My DevOps Journey Do far
Long Story but in a short version.  I joinded Discord after attending Code Vipassana.  Few weeks passed.  Then found out I can join other discord servers and joined the Google Developer community most likely after seeing a post in one of Code Vipassana's channel.  It was really interesting as there were so many channels and bumped into a post about a free Postman API course on LetsUpgrade.in on its #India channel.  Enlisted on that course which needed a mobile number.  Then discovered LetsUpgrade's Discord server and joined it.  There I saw more links to YouTube videos and got interested in the Git course and eventually settled to watch their Git & GitHub Essential Bootcamp | 4th May https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2U8BLk0YRjAMseKd3w2UuJzL57TQ1J-c I did watch their newer version by another member but when through and picked the earliest one from their YouTude channel.  I learnt and practised the below after revisiting my Github repo I created when I tried the GitHub Skills training guide back in May and copied the contents of :
1. git config global
2. git add .
3. git commit -m
4. Git Pages via the GitHub GUI
5. git clone
4. git push
